# LotteryDao
LDAO (Lottery Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an EOS-based DAPP (Distributed Application). Since EOS's main chain has not yet been formally launched, LDAO currently performs verification development on ETH. After the EOS backbone is fully operational, we will launch a comprehensive development effort based on EOS.
With the current rapid development progress of EOS, it is estimated that the main chain can be formally put into operation around June 2018, and we will move the development work to the main chain of EOS synchronously.
